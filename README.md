# Inflation and Crime in Pakistan
In this repo I am making and analysis related with Omdena's project about inflation on food prices and crime rate of Pakistan organized by Pakistan-Chapter.

### Original project's name

Name: **Building an interactive dashboard to report and analyse the relationship between recent inflation in food prices and the increased crime rate within Pakistan**

This is challenge is lead by [**Lahore, Pakistan Chapter**](https://omdena.com/local-chapters/lahore-pakistan-chapter/).

### Project background.

Recently, there has been a surge of inflation in Pakistan. This has had a series of adverse effects on the livelihood and economy of the people. The purpose of this project is to gather and search for data from various sources and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis and understand the trend in the rising prices over the years. We will also build a potential web scraper to extract this information if it is needed. We will further explore the process of building effective and interactive data visualisations to display the data. We will build and deploy an interactive dashboard to display the results.

### The problem.

Recently, there has been a surge of inflation in Pakistan. This has had a series of adverse effects on the livelihood and economy of the people. The purpose of this project is to gather and search for data from various sources and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis and understand the trend in the rising prices over the years. We will also build a potential web scraper to extract this information if it is needed. We will further explore the process of building effective and interactive data visualisations to display the data. We will build and deploy an interactive dashboard to display the results.
We need to gather relevant data related to the project. We will analyze the trends in the data. This project aims to tackle the issue of scarcity of relevant data related to this issue and aims to research and build interactive visualisations.

### Project goals.

1. Using various visuals, analyse the trends in food prices and crime rate.
2. Work with databases and build a web scraper if needed to extract relevant data.
3. Build and deploy an interactive dashboard.
4. building rest apis and an interactive web app to display the results.

### Project plan.

| Week 1|Week 2 |Week 3 |Week 4 |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|<ul><li>Understanding of Problem Statement</li><li>Data gathering</li><li>Building web scraping scripts</li></ul>|<ul><li>Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)</li><li>Building Dashboard & Visualisations</li><li>Introduction to REST APIs & Web Applications</li></ul>|<ul><li>Building Backend API</li><li>Building Front-end</li><li>Workshop on Docker And Docker Compose</li></ul>|<ul><li>Finish Integrating Web App</li><li>Deploy the App in Cloud Application Platforms</li></ul>|

### Learning outcomes.

1. Collection of Data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Building insightful Data Visualisations.
4. Build REST API with Flask.
5. Dockerizing and deploying a Web Application.
